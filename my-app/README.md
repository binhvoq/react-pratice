## File Descriptions

- `src/App.js`: This file is the entry point of the React application. It renders the `MyComponent` component and wraps it with the `MyContextProvider` component from the `MyContext` context.

- `src/context/MyContext.js`: This file exports a `MyContext` object created using the `createContext` function from the React library. It also exports a `MyContextProvider` component that provides the context value to its children.

- `src/components/MyComponent.js`: This file exports a `MyComponent` component that consumes the `MyContext` context using the `useContext` hook from the React library. It renders the context value and provides a button to update the context value.

- `src/index.js`: This file is the entry point of the React application. It renders the `App` component and mounts it to the root element in the HTML document.

- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.

- `yarn.lock`: This file is automatically generated by Yarn to lock the versions of the installed dependencies.

Please refer to the individual files for more details on their implementation.
